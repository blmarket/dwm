 dwm (6.0-5) experimental; urgency=low
 .
   * debian/control
     + Changed Homepage to http://dwm.suckless.org thanks to David Kalnischkies
       for pointing out
     + Increased minimum debhelper required to 9
     + Removed DM-Upload-Allowed field as it will be deprecated soon.
     + Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.4, this didn't require any change to the
       package source.
     + Added dependency on xterm | x-terminal-emulator
   * Set debian/compat to 9
   * debian/rules
     + Removed hardening related lines. Since dwm package now uses compat level 9
       hardening will be automagically done by debhelper
   * debian/local/config.maintainer.h:
     + Changed tag 1 class to x-terminal-emulator so any terminal conforming to
       this virtual package will be placed in tag 1
